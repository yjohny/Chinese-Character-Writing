# Chinese Character Writing Practice App

iOS app (Swift 5.9 / SwiftUI) for learning to write Chinese characters with spaced repetition.

## Build

Xcode project generated via XcodeGen from `project.yml`. iOS 17.0+ deployment target.

```
xcodegen generate   # regenerate .xcodeproj from project.yml
```

No external package dependencies — uses only Apple frameworks.

## Architecture

- **UI**: SwiftUI with PencilKit for handwriting input
- **Persistence**: SwiftData (ReviewCard, UserProfile, ReviewLog)
- **Recognition**: Stroke-based matching (StrokeMatcher) with Vision OCR fallback (`VNRecognizeTextRequest`)
- **Audio**: AVFoundation text-to-speech (`AVSpeechSynthesizer`)
- **Spaced repetition**: FSRS v5 algorithm (FSRSEngine.swift)

### Study flow state machine (StudyState.swift)

```
idle → presenting → writing → recognizing → correct → (next card)
                                                          ↓          ↓
                                                          ↓     [Review Strokes] → showingStrokeOrder → (next card)
                                           → incorrect → showingStrokeOrder → tracing → rewriting → recognizing
                                                                                        ↑                     ↓
                                                                                        └── (if incorrect) ───┘
                                                                                                  (if correct) → (next card)
```

Practice auto-starts on appear (idle is just a loading state). Users can tap "Done" in the toolbar at any time to end practice. The session-complete screen shows stats and a "Practice More" button (no separate "Done" — users switch tabs to leave). On the correct screen, a "Review Strokes" button lets users optionally watch the stroke order animation before advancing; `isReviewingAfterCorrect` tracks this so `strokeOrderComplete()` skips tracing and goes straight to the next card. The rewrite step uses stroke matching (with Vision OCR fallback) to verify the user wrote the character correctly before advancing — they must get it right.

### Key directories

- `Models/` — CharacterEntry, StrokeData, ReviewCard, FSRSEngine, StudyState
- `Services/` — CharacterDataService, StrokeRenderer, StrokeMatcher, SessionManager, RecognitionService, TTSService
- `Views/Practice/` — PracticeView, PracticeViewModel, WritingCanvasView, StrokeOrderView, TracingCanvasView, CharacterPromptView
- `Resources/` — characters.json (494 chars, grades 1-6), strokes.json (SVG paths + medians from Make Me a Hanzi)

## Important conventions

- Stroke SVG data uses a 1024×1024 coordinate space with Y-axis flipped (origin top-left, y=900 is baseline). StrokeRenderer handles the transform. The SVG parser tracks `lastCubicControl` for proper S/s smooth cubic Bezier reflection.
- CharacterPromptView intentionally hides the Chinese example word text so users recall from audio only.
- WritingCanvasContainer and TracingCanvasView use a solid `Color.white` background behind the transparent PKCanvasView so strokes are visible in both light and dark mode. Do not use `.systemBackground` — it turns black in dark mode, making black ink invisible.
- Recognition is two-tier: **StrokeMatcher** (primary) compares the user's PKDrawing strokes against the expected character's median centerlines from strokes.json. It uses **bounding-box normalization** — each set of strokes (user and expected) is centered at (0.5, 0.5) and scaled by `max(width, height)`, making matching invariant to position and scale within the writing area. Greedy matching uses **soft composite scoring** per stroke: a weighted blend of direction (20%), start-point proximity (20%), polyline distance (30%), and DTW shape distance (30%). A stroke matches if its composite score < 1.0 (where 1.0 means "at threshold on average"). A hard ceiling at 2× any single threshold rejects clearly wrong strokes regardless of composite score. StrokeMatcher uses a **two-pass strategy**: a strict pass with the original thresholds (angle ≤65°, start ≤22%, distance ≤15%, DTW ≤0.18) and grade-based match ratios (75%/80%/85%), then a relaxed pass (thresholds ≈1.4× strict: angle ≤80°, start ≤30%, distance ≤21%, DTW ≤0.25) that requires 90% of strokes to match. Stroke count must be within ±max(2, expected/3). PracticeView syncs `canvasSize` to PracticeViewModel for the normalization.
- **Vision OCR** (fallback) runs only when stroke matching fails or stroke data is unavailable. Uses a lenient confidence threshold (0.15), checks all top-10 candidates, sets `customWords` to the expected character, and enables `usesLanguageCorrection`. RecognitionService renders the PKDrawing to an opaque sRGB 512×512 image (`format.opaque = true`, `preferredRange = .standard`, `format.scale = 1.0`) and scales the drawing up so its longest dimension fills 432pt. Forces a light-mode trait collection via `performAsCurrent` so PencilKit always renders black ink as black regardless of device appearance.
- There is a manual "I got it right" override button for when Vision OCR misrecognizes valid handwriting.
- The incorrect flow should be encouraging, never use failure language. Use orange (not red) icons and phrases like "Let's practice the strokes!" — the goal is to get users to write it again correctly, not to punish them.
- New card pacing: gated by relearning count (`maxRelearningBeforeStopNew = 5`) — new cards stop when 5+ recently-missed characters are in the relearning queue. A due-review backstop (`maxDueBeforeStopNew = 50`) also pauses new cards if the review backlog is large (e.g. after time away).
- iPad layout: `AdaptiveLayout` switches to side-by-side HStack on regular width class. Canvas size is 420pt on iPad, 300pt on iPhone. Views that show prompt + canvas pairs use this adaptive layout.
- WritingCanvasView coordinator must update its `parent` reference in `updateUIView` so SwiftUI binding updates propagate correctly.

## Async task management

- PracticeViewModel uses a single `pendingTask: Task<Void, Never>?` to track in-flight async work (recognition, delayed transitions). The previous task is always cancelled before launching a new one. `endPractice()` and `loadNextCard()` cancel pending tasks. All Task continuations must check `Task.isCancelled` and verify the expected `studyState` after every `await` before mutating state.
- StrokeOrderView stores its animation as a `@State` Task and cancels it in `.onDisappear`. Animation state is reset in `startAnimation()` so it works correctly for subsequent characters.
- TTSService nils out `completion` before calling `stopSpeaking` to prevent the cancelled utterance's delegate from firing the wrong callback. Both `didFinish` and `didCancel` delegate methods are implemented. `didCancel` fires the completion if it's non-nil — this only happens on system-initiated cancellations (e.g. app backgrounded); our own `stop()`/`speak()` nil it first, so their cancellations remain no-ops.
- PracticeView observes `scenePhase` and calls `PracticeViewModel.handleReturnToForeground()` when the app becomes `.active`. This transitions `.presenting → .writing` in case the TTS completion was swallowed during backgrounding, preventing the state machine from getting stuck with unresponsive buttons.

## FSRS implementation notes

- `nextDifficulty` mean-reverts toward D0(3) (Good rating), not D0(4), per FSRS v5 spec.
- `scheduleLearning` and `scheduleReview` compute `newD` first, then pass `newD` (not the old difficulty) to `stabilityAfterSuccess`/`stabilityAfterFailure`.
- `FSRSEngine.init` requires exactly 19 weights (enforced by precondition).
